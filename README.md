# odin-project_to-do2
Goal = have simple to-do list.

I can create forks of this project or create entirely new repos where the to-do list is made a little more complex.

Let' start simple and then gradually build up from there. 

1. [DONE] initalise project
    - [DONE] webpack
    - [DONE] html
    - [DONE] js
    - [DONE] css
    - [DONE] load everything in js 
        - [DONE] input module
        - [DONE] list module

2. load input 
    - input field
    - add project button

3. load list of projects
    - when add project button is clicked
        - load title
        - load list of projects
            - checkbox
            - text of project (cant be changed)
            - delete button
                - when delete button is pressed, remove entire row of project from list

4. save to local storage so data persists
